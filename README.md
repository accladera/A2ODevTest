## Test for Web App Developers

This is a project that includes both the backend and frontend. The backend is developed using Django REST Framework and the frontend using React.
## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
Project_Name 'A2ODevTest'/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ backend 'a2oDevBack'/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ frontend 'a2oDev'/
    â”œâ”€â”€ public/
    â”œâ”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- **backend/**: Contains the backend code developed in Django REST Framework.
- **frontend/**: Contains the frontend code developed in React.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/accladera/A2ODevTest.git
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Docker yet, please follow the [official installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.


## Running the Project

### Running React JS Frontend 

To run the Docker container and access the React app, follow these steps:

* Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    docker pull accladeram/a2odev
    ```

* Once the image is downloaded, run the container with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -d -it --name frontend -p 3000:3000 accladeram/a2odev
    ```

   This command will start the container in detached mode and map port 3000 of the container to port 3000 of your host machine.

* Access the React app in your web browser by navigating to the following URL:

    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

   You should see the React app running inside the Docker container rendered in your web browser.

#### Stopping the Container

When you're done using the React app, you can stop the Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker stop frontend
```

### Running Django REST Framework Backend

To run the Docker container and access the Django REST API, follow these steps:

* Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    docker pull accladeram/a2odevback
    ```

* Once the image is downloaded, run the container with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -d -it --name backend -p 8000:8000 accladeram/a2odevback
    ```

   This command will start the container in detached mode and map port 8000 of the container to port 80000 of your host machine.

* Access the API in your web browser by navigating to the following URL:

    ```
    http://localhost:8000
    ```
